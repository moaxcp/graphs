== Create a graph using edge methods

A graph can be constructed by calling edge methods. The vertices declared in the calls are implicitly created. The
following examples create this graph.

`edge` methods return the graph and can be chained to add multiple edges. `getEdge` methods return the Edge so it can
modified. This allows properties to be added, removed, or updated including the "to" and "from" vertices of the edge.

The endpoint vertices are returned by the methods `fromVertex` and `toVertex`. These can be used to modify the vertices.



== Create a graph using vertex methods

A graph can be constructed by only calling vertex methods. A Vertex will be returned which can then be connected to
other vertices using `connectsTo` or `connectsFrom`.

graph.getVertex("A").connectsTo("B");
