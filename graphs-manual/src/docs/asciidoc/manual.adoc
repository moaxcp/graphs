== What is a graph

A graph is a data structure containing a set of vertices and a set of edges. A vertex is typically a value and an edge
is a relationship between two vertices (or values). The relationship (or edge) may be directional. The `Graph`
interface in this library follows these concepts. Values are represented as properties of a `Graph`, `Vertex`, or
`Edge`. Some properties are required some are optional.

=== properties

Vertices must have an `id` property which must be unique to all vertices in the `Graph`.

Edges must have a `from` value which represents the `Vertex` the `Edge` connects from (or
source vertex) and a `to` value which represents the `Vertex` the `Edge` connects to (the target vertex). Edges may
have an optional `id` value.

Graphs may have an optional `id`.

In addition,
vertices and edges can have other values associated to them. These extra properties can be used to represent other
values. For instance, if the graph needs to be represented in graphviz there can be properties for color and style.

`Graphs` may also have properties associated to them. The `Graph`
interface represents a property graph.

=== inherited properties

Vertices and edges in a graph can inherit properties from common vertex properties and edge properties setup in the
graph.

== Representing a graph as code

The `Graph` interface defines methods for building a graph as well as inner classes `Vertex` and `Edge`. The Inner
classes for Vertex and Edge provide a perspective of the graph from those elements. Edges can change their endpoints
and modify properties. Vertices can add new edges and modify properties.

To make a `Graph` instantiate an implementation class.

var undirectedEventGraph = new UndirectedEventGraph<String>();

== Create a graph using edge methods

A graph can be constructed by calling edge methods. The vertices declared in the calls are implicitly created. The
following examples create this graph.

`edge` methods return the graph and can be chained to add multiple edges. `getEdge` methods return the Edge so it can
modified. This allows properties to be added, removed, or updated including the "to" and "from" vertices of the edge.

== Create a graph using vertex methods

A graph can be constructed by calling `getVertex` methods. A Vertex will be returned which can then be connected to
other vertices using `connectsTo` or `connectsFrom`.

== Visualize a graph with graphviz

Graphs can be visualized using the `graphs-graphviz` module. The module converts a graph to the `dot` language or an
image. Example:

== pre-order iterator and pre-order stream

And iterator and stream are provided to perform pre-order depth first traversals.
