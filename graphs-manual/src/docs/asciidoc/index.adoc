== What is a property graph

A graph is a data structure containing a set of vertices and a set of edges. A vertex is typically a value and an edge
is a relationship between two vertices (or values). The graph may be directed or undirected. The `PropertyGraph`
interface provides a dsl for declaring vertices, edges and properties. It is the main interface for representing a
graph. Values are represented as properties of a `PropertyGraph`, `Vertex`, or `Edge`. Some properties are required some are
optional. The rest of the guide will walk through the key concepts of the library.

== Design

The API is designed with the following in mind:

* a graph is always valid.
* referencing missing elements will create them
* for event graphs, each action (creating and modifying a graph, vertices, or edges), will result in a single event
* never return null or accept null (use optionals and overload methods)
* interfaces allow for immutable implementations

=== PropertyGraph

* consists of vertices and edges
* May be directed or undirected
* edges must always connect vertices
* undirected may only have one edge between any two vertices
* directed may only have one edge in each direction between any two vertices
* may have an 'id'
* has properties
* has properties inherited by all vertices
* has properties inherited by all edges

=== EventPropertyGraph
* Works exactly like a `PropertyGraph` and sends events to the EventBus when modified

=== Elements
* vertices and edges of parent graph
* inherit properties from parent graph
* has local properties
* local properties override inherited properties

=== Vertex
* must have 'id' property
* id must be unique for all vertices in graph

=== Edge
* must have source and target properties
* source and target connect two vertices by id
* may have an id

== Representing a graph as code

The `PropertyGraph` interface defines methods for building a graph as well as inner classes `Vertex` and `Edge`. These Inner
classes provide a perspective of the graph from those elements. Edges can change their endpoints, navigate to an
endpoint and modify properties. Vertices can add new edges, get in, out, and adjacent edges, and modify properties.

There are two implementations of `PropertyGraph` in the `graphs-core` module.

include::{sourcedir}/com/github/moaxcp/graphs/manual/RepresentingAPropertyGraphAsCode.java[tags=graphsCore]
----

There are two other implementations of `PropertyGraph` in the 'graphs-greenrobot` module. These implementations send events to the EventBus when the graph is created or modified.

Note: Only greenrobot is currently supported but adding support for Guava's EventBus should be possible.

----

`graphs-test` provides a solutions for assertions on the `EventBus`. It shows that the two creation events were sent to the bus.

=== Create or modify a vertex

To create or modify a vertex use the `vertex` or `getVertex` methods.

[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::{sourcedir}/com/github/moaxcp/graphs/manual/RepresentingAPropertyGraphAsCode.java[tags=vertex]
----

`vertex` methods will return the graph while `getVertex` methods will return the vertex. This allows for different
forms of method chaining.

An `EventPropertyGraph` will send `VertexCreated` events to subscribers.

[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::{sourcedir}/com/github/moaxcp/graphs/manual/RepresentingAPropertyGraphAsCode.java[tags=vertexEvent]
----

If a vertex already exists in the graph it can be modified.

[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::{sourcedir}/com/github/moaxcp/graphs/manual/RepresentingAPropertyGraphAsCode.java[tags=modifyVertex]
----

The first call to `vertex` creates vertex `A` with a property `color` set to `red`. The second call changes the property `color` to `blue`.

If graph is an `EventPropertyGraph` first `VertexCreatedEvent`,then `VertexPropertyEvent` will be sent to the `EventBus`.

[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::{sourcedir}/com/github/moaxcp/graphs/manual/RepresentingAPropertyGraphAsCode.java[tags=modifyVertexEvents]
----

In this case a `VertexCreatedEvent` is sent to the `EventBus`.

=== Create or modify an edge

To create or modify an edge use the `edge` or `getEdge` methods. If the vertices do not already exist they will be created.

[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::{sourcedir}/com/github/moaxcp/graphs/manual/RepresentingAPropertyGraphAsCode.java[tags=edge]
----

Similar to `vertex` methods, `edge` methods will return the graph and `getEdge` will return the `Edge`.

With an `EventPropertyGraph` the `EdgeCreatedEvent` will be sent to the bus. If any of the vertices need to be created `VertexCreatedEvent` will be sent to the bus.

[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::{sourcedir}/com/github/moaxcp/graphs/manual/RepresentingAPropertyGraphAsCode.java[tags=edgeEvent]
----

If an edge already exits in the graph it can be modified.

[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::{sourcedir}/com/github/moaxcp/graphs/manual/RepresentingAPropertyGraphAsCode.java[tags=modifyEdge]
----

The first call to `edge` creates edge `A -> B` with property `color` set to `red`. The second call changes the property
`color` to `green`.

If the graph is an `EventPropertyGraph` events will be sent to the `EventBus`.

[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::{sourcedir}/com/github/moaxcp/graphs/manual/RepresentingAPropertyGraphAsCode.java[tags=modifyEdgeEvents]
----

First a `VertexCreatedEvent` for vertex `A` is sent to the `EventBus`. Followed by a `VertexCreatedEvent` for vertex
`B`. Then an `EdgeCreatedEvent` for the edge between them. Finally, an `EdgePropertyEvent` for the change in color from red to green.

=== properties

The `PropertyGraph` interface is used to represent a property graph. This means graphs, vertices, and edges can have properties added to them. These properties can be used to represent
anything. For instance, if the graph needs to be represented in graphviz there can be properties for color and style.

Id properties are different. For graphs and edges the id property is optional.

==== id properties

The generic parameter in `PropertyGraph<ID>` represents the type for all id properties.

Vertices must have an `id` property which is unique to all vertices in the `PropertyGraph`.

Edges must have a `source` property which represents the `Vertex` the `Edge` connects from (or source vertex) and a `target`
property which represents the `Vertex` the `Edge` connects to (the target vertex). Edges may have an optional `id`
property.

Graphs may have an optional `id`.

`id` properties are not final. They can be changed like normal properties.

==== inherited properties

Vertices and edges in a graph can inherit properties from common vertex properties and edge properties setup in the
graph.

[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::{sourcedir}/com/github/moaxcp/graphs/manual/RepresentingAPropertyGraphAsCode.java[tags=inheritedProperties]
----

The default color for all vertices and edges is set to `"green"` and `"red"` respectively.

== Visualize a graph with graphviz

Graphs can be visualized using the `graphs-graphviz` module. The module converts a graph to the `dot` language or an
image. Example:

----
include::{sourcedir}/com/github/moaxcp/graphs/manual/VisualizeAPropertyGraph.java[tags=dot]
----

image::images/edgeMethods.png[edge methods]

EventGraphs can also be visualized as an animated gif. Each event creates a new frame in the gif.

== Create a graph using edge methods

A graph can be constructed by calling edge methods. The vertices declared in the calls are implicitly created.


[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::{sourcedir}/com/github/moaxcp/graphs/manual/EdgeMethods.java[tags=edge]
----

Edge methods will create vertices and can also add properties to the edge.

The properties can be anything but here they are used for graphviz.


[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::{sourcedir}/com/github/moaxcp/graphs/manual/VisualizeAPropertyGraph.java[tags=dot]
----

image::images/edgeMethods.png[edge classification]

`edge` methods return the graph and can be chained to add multiple edges. If an `Edge` instance is needed use `getEdge`
instead. `getEdge` return the Edge so it can modified. This allows properties to be added, removed, or updated
including the "source" and "target" vertices of the edge. `getEdge` can also be used to declare properties on the edge.

[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::{sourcedir}/com/github/moaxcp/graphs/manual/EdgeMethods.java[tags=getEdge]
----

The previous example used a `DirectedPropertyGraph`. In a directed graph two edges can be between two vertices as is shown
between vertex `A` and `B`. The must go in opposite directions. If the graph were an instance of `UndirectedPropertyGraph`,
there would only be one edge between vertex `A` and `B`.

----
graph.getEdge("A", "B");
graph.getEdge("B", "A");
----

In an `UndirectedPropertyGraph` both calls to `getEdge` returns the same edge instance. The first call creates the edge.

== Create a graph using vertex methods

A graph can be constructed by calling `getVertex` methods. A Vertex will be returned which can then be connected to
other vertices using `connectsTo` or `connectsFrom`.

== EventPropertyGraphs

EventPropertyGraphs are designed to send events to an eventbus when they are created or modified. The interface `EventPropertyGraph` and event classes are defined in `graphs-core`. There are two implementations supporting different eventbus' `graphs-greenrobot` and `graphs-guava`.

== Releases

== 0.15.0

Adding new project `graphs-guava` and `graphs-graphviz-guava-gif`.

== 0.14.0

Adding graphs-graphviz-greenrobot-gif subproject which contains a greenrobot subscriber that can automatically create gifs.

== 0.13.0

Renaming Graph to PropertyGraph. Renaming "from" to source and "to" to target.

== 0.12.0

Adding gif support to graphs-graphviz module. This allows gif animations to be built from an `EventGraph`. It is enabled with the greenrobotgif capability in gradle.


=== 0.11.0

Updating to jdk 17. Updating gradle and all dependencies.

Found issue when getting and edge with different ordered endpoints in an UndirectedGraph. This test now passes:

----
var edge1 = graph.getEdge("A", "B");
var edge2 = graph.getEdge("B", "A");
assertThat(edge1).isEqualTo(edge2);
----

This all came down to how the `Objects.hash(...)` method is ordered but undirected edges need an unordered hash. The
solution is to simply add the hashcodes of the two ids together. This is similar to how HashSet calculates its
`hashCode()`.

Adding `boolean connected(ID from, ID to)` to `PropertyGraph` and `boolean connected(ID id) to `Vertex`. This can be used to check if two vertices are connected. It can
be used to enforce that the graph is always a DAG when adding edges.

=== 0.10.0

Attempting to fix oss nexus publishing by using suggestions found https://github.com/Codearte/gradle-nexus-staging-plugin/blob/master/README.md#2-why-my-release-build-on-travis-suddenly-started-to-fail-with-wrong-number-of-received-repositories[here].

Changing `Optional<Object> getProperty(String)` to `Optional<String> findProperty(String)` and adding
`<T> T getProperty(String)`. This will allow the type of a property to be inferred and remove the need to cast.

```
String value = graph.getProperty("name");
```

Adding remove method to `Vertex` and `Edge`

```
graph.getVertex("A").remove();
graph.getEdge("A", "B").remove();
```

=== 0.9.0

Adding the asciidoctor manual.

=== 0.8.0

Added iterators and streams for pre-order, post-order, and breadth first traversals.

=== 0.7.0

* `id`, `to`, and `from` are now properties of elements and will be present in calls to `local()`
* Rewrote events to support multiple property changes in a single event

=== 0.6.0

* Setting an existing property to null now removes it.
* Fixed sonar test coverage reporting.
* switch travis-ci to use a nix environment to build and publish the projects.

=== 0.5.0

Adding convenience methods for creating and updating elements with multiple properties. For example:

----
graph.vertex("A", "name1", "value1", "name2", "value2");
graph.getVertex("B").property("name1", "value1", "name2", "value2");
----

`vertex` and `edge` methods now return the `Graph` `getVertex` and `getEdge` return the corresponding element.

=== 0.4.0

Splitting projects into core, greenrobot, graphviz, and truth. Added support for java modules.

=== 0.3.0

Added initial support for graphviz. Added getProperties(), getEdgeProperties(), and getVertexProperties() to Graph api.
Removing edgeTo(), edgeFrom(), vertexTo(), and vertexFrom() methods in Vertex to reduce complexity of api.

=== 0.2.0

Javadoc for `Vertex.setId` has been updated to throw IllegalArgumentException of a vertex with id already exists. This
case is also now tested. `getBus` and generic type `BUS` has been removed from EventGraph. Fixed bug #22 where setting
`from` or `to` on an edge does not result in an event.

=== 0.1.1

This release fixes a major issue where changing a vertex id resulted in adjacentEdges, inEdges, and outEdges being
inaccurate. A check was also added to `Vertex.setId` which throws IllegalArgumentException if a vertex with id already
exists.

=== 0.1.0

This release includes the main Graph interface and implementations for undirected and directed graphs. There are also
event graph implementations which post to greenrobot's event bus. The events are immutable and may be used to track
changes in the graph by visualizations and other tools. Some edge methods have been benchmarked using jmh and optimized
for performance.
