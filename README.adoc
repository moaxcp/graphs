= graphs

An easy to use java api for graphs with support for properties and event streaming. The graph api follows
a few principles which keeps things simple for the user:

* a graph is always valid
* referencing missing elements will create them
* for event graphs, creating and changing a graph, vertices, or edges will result in an event
* never return null
